For [elm-conf](https://elm-conf.com) 2019, I created a [6 degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) inspired game for the Marvel universe. I found a [Marvel GraphQL endpoint](https://github.com/Novvum/MarvelQL) and created [6 degrees of Squirrel Girl](https://github.com/glitteringkatie/squirrel-degrees). You can find a pdf of my slides [here](./graphqsquirrel.pdf). Enjoy!
