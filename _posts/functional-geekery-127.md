I was interviewed on a podcast called [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/). [Proctor](https://twitter.com/stevenproctor) and I talked about my functional programming origin story: starting at my first internship, learning about Elm, and getting more involved. We spoke both about my [first talk](../where-the-elm-am-i) and a bit about [my upcoming Squirrel Girl talk](../graphq-squirrel) since I was in the middle of working on it at the time.

[Have a listen over at Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-127-katie-hughes/) or your podcatcher of choice!
