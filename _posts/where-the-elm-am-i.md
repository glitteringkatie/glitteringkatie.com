After recently joining [NoRedInk](https://www.noredink.com/) and moving to San Francisco, I gave a talk at [Elm in the Spring](https://elminthespring.org/) 2019 about exploring one of the larger [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) codebases and paralleled it to exploring a new city. You can find a pdf of my slides [here](where-the-elm.pdf). Enjoy!
